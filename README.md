    👋 Hi, I’m @jaydev
    👀 I’m interested in exploring the intricacies of technology and its diverse applications.
    🌱 I’m currently on a continuous learning journey, delving into Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge and expand my technical skills while making a positive impact.
